My working portfolio site, meant to serve as a landing page and become more advanced over time, in between projects, code refinement in old projects, learning new skills and job search.  Goal was to have some personality reflection while demonstrating and highlighting skills.
Something to mention, the files of my current portfolio are primarily under 'working_changes.' The rest of the files were me transitioning from my really old portfolio and wanting to hold onto certain images and code snippets.  My plan is to make future, major changes in version control, store graphics and snippets I want to keep in some kind of content managment system, etc.  But for now, I thought I'd just add it as is to github to keep track of things/show code if someone wants to see.
Skills demonstrated within the portfolio itself:
-CSS
-responsive web design
-ThreeJS library
-ParticleJS library
-Phaser library
-JavaScript


Plans for this portfolio project:
-Probably host my blog here, with some element of login features
-Incorporate React in parts or most of site
-Re-do "art" gallery, it only serves a purpose for now
-Re-do some of the styling of the front landing page, the green is fun, but intense
-Probably some other stuff
