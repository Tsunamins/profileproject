Don't Forget!

have to clear cache and hard reload typically to see these changes

When working locally need './....' before file typically
        for whatever reason need to do ./images/whatever file here instead
        './images/waternormals.jpg' within the js folder, within the referencing js file

When online '/.....' was what came from cpanel
However = nested file names are a little different
    example: image ref from js file to go up one level go into /images
                '../images/monograd.png' within the js folder, within the referncing js file


js files importing other files or libraries seem to be fine as is


easy check, locally, just put filename then can see where http-server is checking



perhaps see if './....will be fine for cpanel
